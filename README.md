# CAP5625 Coursework  
  
* [Assignment 1](https://github.com/MichaelTeti/CAP5625/blob/main/CAP5625_Assignment1_RidgeRegression.ipynb)
  - Implement ridge regression with cross validation via batch gradient descent "by hand" (i.e. without sklearn, pytorch, glmnet, etc.) in the programming language of your choice 
  - Plot coefficient values vs ridge tuning parameter lambda.   
  - Plot the mean MSE across all cross validation folds for each lambda.  
  - Print the optimal value of lambda found with cross validation.  
  - Print the optimal coefficient vector.  
  - Compare fit against that of an ML library (e.g. sklearn, glmnet, etc.)  
* Assignment 2: Implement elastic net with cross validation "by hand" and compare results from an ML library.
